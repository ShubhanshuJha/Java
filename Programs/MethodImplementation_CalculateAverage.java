/* About Constructor:
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize class variables at the time of object creation.
Each time an object is created using the new() keyword, a constructor is called. A constructor can be created by the
programmer. If the developer does not create any constructor, then, Java provides a default constructor.
In the previous examples, we had not created any constructor, but Java provided a default constructor for every class.
Constructors have the same name as that of the class and does not have a return type.

A constructor with no arguments is known as a parameterless constructor. If you donâ€™t define a constructor in a class,
then Java creates a default parameterless constructor and initializes the default values to the class variables based on
the data type. */
