## Definition:
In Cryptography, SHA is cryptographic hash function which takes input as 20 Bytes and rendered the hash value in hexadecimal number, 40 digits long approx.

The SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions consists of six hash functions. These are:
    SHA-224, with 224 bit hash values
    SHA-256, with 256 bit hash values
    SHA-384, with 384 bit hash values
    SHA-512, with 512 bit hash values
    SHA-512/224, with 512 bit hash values
    SHA-512/256, with 512 bit hash values

Among these, SHA-256 and SHA-512 are the most commonly accepted and used hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values.
To calculate cryptographic hashing value in Java, MessageDigest Class is used, under the package java.security.

## Message Digest Class:
To calculate cryptographic hashing value in Java, MessageDigest Class is used, under the package java.security.
MessagDigest Class provides following cryptographic hash function to find hash value of a text as follows:
    MD2
    MD5
    SHA-1
    SHA-224
    SHA-256
    SHA-384
    SHA-512

These Algorithms are initialized in static method called getInstance(). After selecting the algorithm it calculate the digest value and return the results in byte array.

BigInteger class is used, which converts the resultant byte array into its sign-magnitude representation. This representation is converted into hex format to get the MessageDigest.
